## Introduction
I wanted more experience with three.js and this was a great project to further my experience. I worked with the following tools to create this web app:

- ThreeJS
- React Three Fiber
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- React
- Vite
- Express
- Vercel

## What I learned
I got a lot more comfortable with the details of three.js and framer motion. This was also my first time using the openAI api to alter something like this. that was very exciting. I think moving forward I will try to find a way to retroactively remove the white background from the logos DALL-E creates. I would like to add a way to resize / move the images around the shirt model for design fine-tuning. Ideally, I would love to add some kind of e-commerce part to this. I feel like that would be a really good addition to this proof of concept.
